This is a Dining Concierge Assistant. We build a Dining Concierge Assistant using Amazon Lex. We use Yelp API to get 5000+ random restaurants from Manhattan and store them in DynamoDB. The Assistant will use OpenSearch to find its recommendations for you. The message will be sent to your email address. 

The project is done on AWS, and the architeture is shown in the blow figure.
